                rounded rye spice character than the more commonly grown Australian rye varieites. This is partly due to
                larger size grain, which is more common to european rye. Expect a harmonious symphony of flavors, where
                the typical denser rye bread character helps to showcase the notes of cloves, pepper, and a hint of
                nuttiness."

                malt for summer pale ales and immediately gained recognition in the craft brewing community for its
                unique characteristics. Using the now very rare Schooner variety grown right here on our farm, Veloria
                has characteristics more aligned to older English varieties. Golden coloured, superb head retention and
                a clean yet rich toasted honey like sweetness assisted by the lower attenuation of the Schooner variety
                make this malt well suited to may craft beer styles."
